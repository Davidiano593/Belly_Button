# Belly Button Biodiversity
## Overview
The purpose of this project is to develop a comprehensive panel of demographic information to create bacterial charts for each volunteer, and specifically to be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons.
That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate for making synthetic meat, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify if that species is in their belly button.

## Results

After creating three different charts we can appreciate the results by filtering them with the information based on the id of the bacteria sample.
The following image shows the three charts based on:
- Top 10 Bacteria Cultures found
- Bacteria Culture Per Sample
- Belly Button Washing Frequency.

Thanks to this information, it is possible to locate the best candidate to develop the project.
